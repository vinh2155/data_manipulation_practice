# data_manipulation_practice

#Why ?

I recently saw an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIlWp3w936s) that *"Machine Learning practitioners spend nearly 80% of their time working with data!"*! Since I am still in the early stage of my learning journey in Data Science, I think I should master the basics in order to save me time for my real projects. That's why I am going to manipulate a dataset.

#Dataset vs Dataframe

Dataset: Any collection of data, which can come in various formats such as CSV files, databases, JSON, or Excel sheets. It's a broad term that refers to data in any structured or unstructured form.
DataFrame: A specific type of data structure, usually in a tabular format, where data is organized into labeled rows and columns. It's used in programming environments like Python's pandas or R for data manipulation and analysis.

#What ?

I'm going to use a dataset that I find interesting to make this practice a fun moment :) I will be using a League of Legends champions dataset in a CSV file that I found on Kaggle !
